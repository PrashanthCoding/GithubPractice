        // Standardization: Using standardized systems, packaging, and practices across the supply chain can help mitigate incompatibility.

        //Interoperability: Ensuring that software systems can communicate with one another (through APIs or middleware) is critical.

        // Collaboration: Building strong relationships and clear communication with partners helps align different logistical practices.

        // Regulatory Alignment: Staying informed about international regulatory requirements and adapting processes to meet them.


        // Incompatibility in logistics is a common challenge but can be addressed through proper planning, technology integration, and coordination between stakeholders.
